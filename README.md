### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ryan, an aspiring Data Analyst.

I've created a few repositories of project i've been working on, as well as select tasks from my DfE Data Science Skills Bootcamp tasks that show what I've been learning. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing the write-ups for my Witcher and Youtube Projects! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build interactive and attractive data dashboards in excel.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm on [LinkedIn]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-pitt-b9321a238/)), say Hi! 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I grow Bonsai Trees!
