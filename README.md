### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ryan, a Lead Analyst working in the financial regtech industry. 

I've created a few repositories of project I've been working on, as well as my struggles learning CTFs.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-pitt-b9321a238/), say Hi! 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I grow Bonsai Trees!
